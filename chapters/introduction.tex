\chapter{Introduction}

This report describes an ethical analysis on two different problems. It is written for the course Computer Ethics at the University of Twente. The scenarios are both related to a fictional hotel which tries to monitor its guests to almost totalitarian degree in order to improve the guest's their stay. With so much sensitive data, this can result in a significant amount of problematic scenarios.

A description of what data is saved is described in chapter \ref{chap:system_description}. The first problem-scenario is about the situation where the hotel is in financial difficulty and someone offers to buy the data. The analysis is about if they should sell the data or not. This is described in chapter \ref{chap:selling_data}. The second problem-scenario is about the situation where the system has a critical security leak and the hotel is not paying for maintenance fees. The software company, which created the system, refuses to fix the leak and the hotel does not know about the leak at all. What should an employee do in this situation and what would we do? This is described in chapter \ref{chap:whistleblowing}. The report is concluded with another possible solution to the second problem-scenario. This is described in chapter \ref{chap:alternate_approach}.
