What should we do if the hotel is financially not-well and we have a buyer of all data whom we know will publish the data?

- Should we sell or not?
- Should we alter negative views on persons?
- Should we alter negative views on groups?
- Should we partially sell the data (only good, only bad)?
- Should we hide "high-profile" clients?
- Should we anonomize the data?
- Should we only sell aggregated data / patterns?
